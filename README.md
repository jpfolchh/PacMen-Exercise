# PacMen-Exercise

## About the Project:
In this project, the goal is to create a pacman on demand (through a button click) in the DOM and move the pacmen created across the page respecting the page's boundaries.

## How to Run:
To run this project on your machine, simply copy the files contained within this repository to your machine, within the same folder/directory. Once on your machine, open the index.html file on any modern browser and click on the "Add PackMen" button to create your first PacMan. From there, you can either click on "Start Game" to get the PacMan moving, our you can continue clicking on the "Add PacMan" to add more PacMen. Either way, you can click on "Add PacMan" at any moment to add instances.

## Future Improvements:
Future improvements to this project include changes to the individual colors and collective direction of the PacMen.
